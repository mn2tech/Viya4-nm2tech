# This block of code is for changing the user that CAS runs as. By default
# the cas container and processes run as 1001 (sas). By modifying the runAsUser
# and runAsGroup securityContext options, you can set the user ID and group ID,
# respectively. The user ID and group ID are only used for the CAS container and
# not for any other containers in the pod.
