# This block of code is for overriding the default secure computing
# profile (seccomp) of "RuntimeDefault" for CAS.
# Setting "/spec/seccompProfile" to "unconfined" will cause
# sas-cas-operator to replace any existing seccomp profile
# configurations with an "Unconfined" seccomp profile for CAS.
#
# Any other values for "/spec/seccompProfile" will set the profile
# type to "Localhost" and require that the "/spec/seccompProfile"
# value is a path to a pre-configured localhostProfile file
# on the Kubernetes node.
