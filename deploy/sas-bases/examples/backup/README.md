# SAS Viya Backup and Restore Utility

The files in this directory are used to create a backup of the SAS Viya platform. You can
perform a one-time backup or you can schedule a regular backup of your
deployment. For information about performing backups and using these files, see
[SAS Viya Platform Administration: Backup and
Restore](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=sasadmincdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=calbr&docsetTarget=titlepage.htm).

**Note:** Ensure that the version indicated by the version selector for the
