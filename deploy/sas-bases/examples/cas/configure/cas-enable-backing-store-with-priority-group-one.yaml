# This patch transformer enables two backing stores for dynamic memory 
# allocations across CAS processes.
# 
# This transformer is appropriate (but not required) for deployments enabling 
# CAS resource management, with a separate backing store for each resource
# management priority group.
# 
# This transformer establishes one backing store for users in priority group
# one and a second backing store for all other users.
#
# Choose the size of each individual backing store before deployment.
# The total size of all resource groups should not exceed 80% of the total memory
# on the nodes that support CAS Pods.
#
# The MEMORY_SIZE_* values are a numeric value followed by the units,
# such as 32Gi for 32 gigabytes. In Kubernetes, the units for gigabytes is Gi and
# is case-sensitive.
