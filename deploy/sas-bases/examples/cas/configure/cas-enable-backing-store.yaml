# This patch transformer enables a backing store for dynamic memory allocations 
# across all CAS processes.
#
# Choose the size of each individual backing store before deployment.
# The total size should not exceed 80% of the total memory on the nodes
# that support CAS pods.
#
# The MEMORY_SIZE value is a numeric value followed by the units,
# such as 32Gi for 32 gigabytes. In Kubernetes, the units for gigabytes is Gi and
# is case-sensitive.
#
# Replace this value with a size that is appropriate for the Kubernetes
# nodes that will support CAS pods
