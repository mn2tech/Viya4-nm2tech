# This block of code is for appending paths to the file system path
# allowlist for the CAS server.  The {{ PATH-OR-VOLUME }} and
# {{ PATH-OR-VOLUME-2 }} values can be either the name of a
# Volume or a direct path.  These two values are provided
# as an example for appending multiple paths to the
# appendCASAllowlistPaths array.
# If the value is the name of a Volume, e.g., "test-data-volume",
# the CAS Operator will discover any Volume Mounts associated with
# that Volume and append those path(s) to the CAS allowlist.
# If the value is a path, e.g., "/data03/test-data", this
# path will appended to the CAS allowlist directly.
