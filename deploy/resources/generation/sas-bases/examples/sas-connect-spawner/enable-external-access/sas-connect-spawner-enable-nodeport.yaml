# Be default the Kubernetes control plane allocates a nodePort from a configured range (default: 30000-32767).
# Each node proxies that port (the same port number on every Node) into your Service.
#
# It is possible to select a nodePort to use with 2 restrictions:
#   1. The selected port must fall within the nodePort range (default: 30000-32767).
#   2. The selected port must be available on all nodes where the service will run.
#
# To use a specific port uncomment the following and replace {{nodePort}} with
# the desired port.
#    nodePort: {{nodePort}}

# NOTE: It is important to keep the default externalTrafficPolicy of Cluster.
#       Changing the externalTrafficPolicy to Local can prevent the correct
