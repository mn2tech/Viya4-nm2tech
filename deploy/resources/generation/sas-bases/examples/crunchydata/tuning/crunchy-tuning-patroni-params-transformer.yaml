# This is an example transformer to override any of Patroni's default parameters.
# NOTE:
#   It is not recommended to change Patroni parameters unless you are very familiar with Patroni tuning.
#
# The variables (only one sample Patroni parameter is listed in this example):
# - {{ CLUSTER-NAME }} is the name of the PostgresCluster. Valid values are:
#    - sas-crunchy-platform-postgres for platform Postgres cluster
#    - sas-crunchy-cds-postgres for CDS Postgres cluster
#    - .* for both clusters. In this case, use a unique name like 'both-clusters' for the transformer metadata name
#    - If different settings are needed for each cluster, then separate transformers must be created:
#        one for Platform Postgres, and the other for CDS Postgres.
# - {{ RETRY-TIMEOUT-VALUE }} is the timeout for DCS and PostgreSQL operation retries (in seconds). Default value: 10
#
# To replace a variable, replace the curly braces, interior spaces, and the variable name with an actual value.
#
# See https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/patroni/latest/pdf/patroni.pdf for more details on Patroni parameters.
# See $deploy/sas-bases/examples/crunchydata/tuning/README.md for how to include this transformer to the base kustomization file.
