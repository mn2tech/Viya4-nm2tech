# This block of code is for altering the CPU reserve allotment for CAS auto-resourcing.
# By default 1 Core is left available for other pods and daemonsets.  If your environment
#  has a large number of daemonsets, consider using this example transformer to increase
#  the cpu reserved for those pods.
# For CPUs, the NUMBER-OF-CORES is either a whole number, representing that
# number of cores, or a number followed by m, indicating that number of milli-cores.
# For example, 8 specifes to allocate 8 cores, and 500m specifies to allocate
# 500 milli-cores or .5 cores.
