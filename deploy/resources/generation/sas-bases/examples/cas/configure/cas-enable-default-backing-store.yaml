# This patch transformer enables a backing store for dynamic memory allocations 
# across all CAS processes.
#
# This transformer does not specify a specific size of the backing store.
# The CAS Operator selects a default value in either of these situations:
#    *  CAS auto-resourcing is enabled.
#    *  the sas-cas-server container specification in the CASDeployment custom
#       resource specifies a memory resource limit.
