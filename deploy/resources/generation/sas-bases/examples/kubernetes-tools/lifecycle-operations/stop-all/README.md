# Lifecycle Operation: Stop-all

You can stop and start your SAS Viya platform deployment by using CronJobs or by applying transformers. For details about both methods, see [Starting and Stopping a SAS Viya Platform Deployment](http://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/itopscdc/default/itopssrv/n0pwhguy22yhe0n1d7pgi63mf6pb.htm#p17xfmmjjkma1dn1b5dcx3e5ejxq).

In order to schedule the stop-all Cronjob, use the start-stop example in `$deploy/sas-bases/examples/kubernetes-tools/lifecycle-operations/schedule-start-stop`.
