# This block of code removes the resource requests for cpu and memory. This is used
#  in conjunction with the auto-resources overlay to enable the sas-cas-operator
#  to automatically determine the resource limits.  This requires that the sas-cas-operator
#  Service account have a ClusterRole to read the 'nodes' resources as created by the
#  cluster-role.yaml and cluster-role-binding.yaml files.
