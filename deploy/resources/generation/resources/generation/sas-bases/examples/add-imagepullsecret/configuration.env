## Example environment file that defines the additional imagePullSecret name to use
## in the deployment. To specify the input, define a value as described below.
##
## For OpenShift deployments that use the OpenShift Container Registry as a mirror,
## the imagePullSecret name is found by using this command:
##
##    kubectl get secrets -n <namespace> | grep builder-dockercfg
##
## The location that requires a user-specified value is indicated by a capitalized
## name set off by curly braces and a space at each end. Replace this token with the
## actual value. Replace the curly braces, interior spaces, and the variable name.
## For instance, {{ IMAGEPULLSECRET_NAME }} should be replaced by the desired
## imagePullSecret name for this deployment.
##
## Example:
## secret-name=builder-dockercfg-c9kp

secret-name={{ IMAGEPULLSECRET_NAME }}
