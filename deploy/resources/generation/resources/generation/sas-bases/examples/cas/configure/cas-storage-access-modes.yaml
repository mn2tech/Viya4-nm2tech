# This block of code is used to modify the PVC access mode for the cas-default-data and
# cas-default-permstore persistentVolumeClaims.
# The default value for ACCESS-MODE is ReadWriteMany. To change it, replace the
# variable with ReadWriteOnce.  ReadWriteOnce is only supported for SMP Deployments with
# no backup controllers and has implications to how the deployment could be altered in the
# future. Refer to the Viya Deployment Documentation for more information.
