# This is an example transformer to customize Crunchy PostgreSQL pgBackRest backup config settings.
# Note: It is NOT for SAS Backup BUT for the internal Crunchy Postgres pgBackRest backup utility.
#
# Uncomment the sections you want to update.
#
# The variables to replace:
# - {{ CLUSTER-NAME }} is the name of the PostgresCluster. Valid values are:
#    - sas-crunchy-platform-postgres for platform Postgres cluster
#    - sas-crunchy-cds-postgres for CDS Postgres cluster
#    - .* for both clusters. In this case, use a unique name like 'both-clusters' for the transformer metadata name
#    - If different settings are needed for each cluster, then separate transformers must be created:
#        one for Platform Postgres, and the other for CDS Postgres.
# - {{ FULL-BACKUP-CRONJOB }} is the schedule for full backups in Cron syntax
#    - The default is every Sunday morning at 06:00 UTC ('0 6 * * 0')
# - {{ INCR-BACKUP-CRONJOB }} is the schedule for incremental backups in Cron syntax
#    - The default is every morning at 06:00 UTC except Sundays ('0 6 * * 1-6')
# - {{ RETENTION-FULL-BACKUP }} is the number of full backups to retain. It must be a string, so quote the number as '2'.
#    - By default, it is "1" to retain only one full backup
# - {{ RETENTION-ARCHIVE-TYPE }} and {{ RETENTION-ARCHIVE }} to control WAL data to retain.
#    - By default, it is 'incr' and '1' to retain one 'incr' backup worth of WAL data. They must be strings, so quote the number as '1'.
#    - The default backups automatically scheduled are weekly full backups and daily incremental backups,
#      so the meaningful values for the backup types are 'full' and 'incr'.
#    - The default settings are aimed to minimize the space consumption by WAL data which takes up much bigger space than backups.
#    - The drawback of the default settings is to limit Point-In-Time-Recovery to the level of the 'incr' backup instead of the WAL data level.
#
# To replace a variable, replace the curly braces, interior spaces, and the variable name with an actual value.
