# This block of code is for specifying the CPU resources for sas-arke pods.
# The default required value is 50m and the default limit is 500m.
# When modifying the CPU resource request for sas-arke pods the
# HorizontalPodAutoscaler averageUtilization may need to be adjusted.
# See arke-modify-hpa-replicas.yaml for an example.
