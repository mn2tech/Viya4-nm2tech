# Configuration Settings for RabbitMQ

## Overview

This README file describes the settings available for deploying RabbitMQ.

## Installation

Based on the following description of the available example files, determine if you
want to use any example file in your deployment. If you do, copy the example
file and place it in your site-config directory.

Each file has information about its content. The variables in the file are set
off by curly braces and spaces, such as {{ NUMBER-OF-NODES }}. Replace the
entire variable string, including the braces, with the value you want to use.

After you have edited the file, add a reference to it in the transformers block
of the base kustomization.yaml file (`$deploy/kustomization.yaml`). Here is an
example using the RabbitMQ nodes transformer:

```yaml
transformers:
...
- site-config/rabbitmq/configuration/rabbitmq-node-count.yaml
```

## Examples

The example files are located at `$deploy/sas-bases/examples/rabbitmq/configuration`.
The following list contains a description of each example file for RabbitMQ settings 
and the file names.

- specify the number of RabbitMQ nodes in the cluster (rabbitmq-node-count.yaml)

**Note:** The default number of nodes is 3. SAS recommends a node count that
is odd such as 1, 3, or 5.

- modify the resource allocation for RAM (rabbitmq-modify-memory.yaml)

**Note:** The default memory limit is 8Gi which may not be sufficient under some
workloads. If the RabbitMQ pods are restarting on their own or if you notice memory
usage above 4Gi, then you should increase the memory limit. RabbitMQ requires the
additional 4Gi for garbage collection.

- modify the resource allocation for CPU (rabbitmq-modify-cpu.yaml)
- modify the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) size or Storage Class for nodes (rabbitmq-modify-pvc-size.yaml)

**Note:** You must delete the RabbitMQ statefulset and PVCs before applying the PVC
size change. Use the following procedure:

1. Delete the RabbitMQ statefulset.

   ```bash
   kubectl -n <name-of-namespace> delete statefulset sas-rabbitmq-server
   ```

2. Wait for all of the pods to terminate before deleting the PVCs. You can check the
status of the RabbitMQ pods with the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n <name-of-namespace> get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=sas-rabbitmq-server
   ```

3. When no pods are listed as output for the command in step 2, delete the PVCs:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n <name-of-namespace> delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/name=sas-rabbitmq-server
   ```
4. (Optional) Enable access to the RabbitMQ Management UI (rabbitmq-enable-management-ui.yaml).

**Note:** 
SAS does not recommend leaving the RabbitMQ Management UI enabled. However, the rabbitmq-enable-management-ui.yaml file can be used for that
purpose. SAS does not recommend adding it to the base kustomization.yaml file.

**Note:** Consider the following when you are reducing resources allocated for RabbitMQ:

- Reducing the RabbitMQ cluster to a single member is not recommended. Without redundancy, disruption during software updates is likely to occur.
- If you want to lower RabbitMQ utilization and find that it has less than 25% CPU usage, you can reduce the cores defined for RabbitMQ to 0.5.

**IMPORTANT:** Starving RabbitMQ of CPU, memory, or disk space can cause RabbitMQ to become unstable, affecting the operation of SAS Viya platform.
