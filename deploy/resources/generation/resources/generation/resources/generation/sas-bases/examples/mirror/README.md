# Using a Mirror Registry

A mirror registry is a local registry of the software necessary to create your deployment.
For the SAS Viya platform, a mirror registry is created with SAS Mirror Manager.

For more information about mirror repositories and SAS Mirror Manager, see [Using a Mirror Registry](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=itopscdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=dplyml0phy0dkr&docsetTarget=n08u2yg8tdkb4jn18u8zsi6yfv3d.htm&locale=en#p16pozfc1zct66n1b8sitnf1vsfk).

**Note:** Ensure that the version indicated by the version selector for the
document matches the version of your SAS Viya platform software.
