## Example PatchTransformer to patch the file objects used by Istio Gateway objects
## Only one of the following files should be included in the site-config location:
## * customer-provided-istio-gateway-certificate-filepath-transformer.yaml
##       This is a good option if you only have a few certificates to be displayed by the ingress gateway
##       as, each additional certificate will require a restart of the ingress-gateway pod.
## * customer-provided-istio-gateway-certificate-sds-transformer.yaml
##       This is a good option if you want many unique certificates to be displayed by the ingress gateway.
##       Additional certificates can be added to ingress-gateway without editing the deployment.
##
## In the following code, the locations that require user specified values are indicated by a capitalized and
## hyphenated name set off by curly braces and a space at each end. You should replace this token with the
## actual value.
## Replace the curly braces, interior spaces, and the variable name.
## For instance, "{{ ISTIO-INGRESSGATEWAY-FILEPATH-TO-SERVER-CERTIFICATE Example: /etc/istio/ingressgateway-certs/tls.crt }}"
## should be replaced with the file path that contains the certificate that will
## be used to secure the ingress gateway.
##
## If you are following the example, the correct final syntax will look like:
##   value: { mode: SIMPLE, serverCertificate: /etc/istio/ingressgateway-certs/tls.crt, privateKey: /etc/istio/ingressgateway-certs/tls.key }
##
