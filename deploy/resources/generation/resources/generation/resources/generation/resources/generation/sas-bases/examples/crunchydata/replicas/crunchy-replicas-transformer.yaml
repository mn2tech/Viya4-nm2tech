# Replace all instances of the variable {{ REPLICAS-COUNT }}, including the braces,
# with the number of PostgreSQL replicas you would like to have.
#
# Note: this is the total count of PostgreSQL nodes you will have, not just the nodes
# acting as "replicas" in a high-availability configuration. For example, using the
# value 3 will result in 3 total PostgreSQL nodes.
