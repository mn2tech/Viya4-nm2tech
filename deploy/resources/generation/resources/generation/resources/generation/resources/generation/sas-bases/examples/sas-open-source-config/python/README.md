# Configure Python for the SAS Viya Platform Using a Kubernetes Persistent Volume

## Overview

The SAS Viya platform can use a customer-prepared environment consisting of a Python installation and any required packages stored on a Kubernetes PersistentVolume.
This README describes how to make that volume available to your deployment.

SAS provides a utility, SAS Configurator for Open Source, that facilitates the download and management of Python from source and partially automates the steps to integrate Python with the SAS Viya platform. SAS recommends that you use this utility. 

For comprehensive documentation related to the configuration of open-source
language integration, including the use of SAS Configurator for Open Source, see [SAS Viya Platform:
Integration with External Languages](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=itopscdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=dplyexternlang&docsetTarget=titlepage.htm).

> **Note:** The examples provided in this README are appropriate for a manual deployment of Python integration. For a deployment that uses SAS Configurator for Open Source, consult [SAS Viya Platform:
Integration with External Languages](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=itopscdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=dplyexternlang&docsetTarget=titlepage.htm).

## Prerequisites

The SAS Viya platform provides YAML files that the Kustomize tool uses to configure Python. Before you use those files, you must perform the following tasks:

1. Make note of the attributes for the volume where Python and the associated packages are to be deployed. For example, note the server and directory for NFS.
   For more information about various types of PersistentVolumes in Kubernetes, see [Additional Resources](#additional-resources).
   If you are deploying on Red Hat OpenShift cluster, you may need to define permissions to the service account for the volume that you mount for Python. For more information about installing the service account overlay, refer to the README file at `/$deploy/sas-bases/overlays/sas-microanalytic-score/service-account/README.md` (for Markdown format) or `$deploy/sas-bases/docs/configure_sas_micro_analytic_service_to_add_service_account.htm` (for HTML format).

2. Install Python and any necessary packages on the volume.

3. In addition to the volume attributes, you must have the following information:

   * {{ PYTHON-EXECUTABLE }} - the name of the Python executable file (for example, python or python3.8)
   * {{ PYTHON-EXE-DIR }} - the directory or partial path (relative to the mount) containing the executable (for example, /bin or /virt_environs/envron_dm1/bin). Note the mount point for your Python deployment should be its top level directory.
   * {{ SAS-EXTLANG-SETTINGS-XML-FILE }} - configuration file for enabling Python and R integration in CAS. This is only required if you are using Python with CMP or the EXTLANG package.
   * {{ SAS-EXT-LLP-PYTHON-PATH }} - list of directories to look for when searching for run-time shared libraries (similar to LD_LIBRARY_PATH)

4. The Python overlay for sas-microanalytic-score uses a Persistent Volume named astores-volume, which is defined in the astores overlay. The Python and astore overlays are usually installed together. If you choose to install the python overlay only, you still need to install the astores overlay as well. For more information on installing the astores overlay, refer to the "Configure SAS Micro Analytic Service to Support Analytic Stores" README file at `$deploy/sas-bases/examples/sas-microanalytic-score/astores/README.md` (for Markdown format) or `$deploy/sas-bases/docs/configure_sas_micro_analytic_service_to_support_analytic_stores.htm` (for HTML format).

## Installation

1. Copy the files in the `$deploy/sas-bases/examples/sas-open-source-config/python` directory to the `$deploy/site-config/sas-open-source-config/python` directory.
   Create the destination directory, if it does not already exist.

   **Note:** If the destination directory already exists, [verify that the overlay](#verify-overlay-for-python-volume) has been applied.
   If the output contains the `/python` mount directory path, you do not need to take any further actions, unless you want to change the overlay parameters to use a different Python environment.

2. The kustomization.yaml file defines all the necessary environment variables. Replace all tags, such as {{ PYTHON-EXE-DIR }}, with the values that you gathered in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) step.
   Then, set the following parameters, according to the SAS products you will be using:

   * MAS_PYPATH and MAS_M2PATH are used by SAS Micro Analytic Service.
   * PROC_PYPATH and PROC_M2PATH are used by PROC PYTHON in the Compute Server. PROC_M2PATH defaults to the correct location in the install, so it's not required to be provided in the kustomization.yaml. However, the example file shows the correct path as the value.
   * DM_PYPATH is used by the Open Source Code node in SAS Visual Data Mining and Machine Learning. You can add DM_PYPATH2, DM_PYPATH3, DM_PYPATH4 and DM_PYPATH5 if you need to specify multiple Python environments.
     The Open Source Code node allows you to choose which of these five environment variables to use during execution.
   * SAS_EXTLANG_SETTINGS is used by applications that run Python and R code on CAS. This includes PROC FCMP and the Time Series External Languages (EXTLANG) package.
     SAS_EXTLANG_SETTINGS should only be set in one example file; for example, if you set it in the Python example, you should not set it the R example.
     SAS_EXTLANG_SETTINGS should point to an XML file that is readable by all users. The path can be in the same volume that contains the R environment or in any other volume that is accessible to CAS.
     Refer to the documentation for the Time Series External Languages (EXTLANG) package for details on the expected XML schema.
   * SAS_EXT_LLP_PYTHON is used when the base distribution or packages for open-source software require additional run-time libraries that are not part of the shipped container image.

   **Note:** Any environment variables that you define in this example will be set on all pods, although they might not have an effect.
   For example, setting MAS_PYPATH will not affect the Python executable used by the EXTLANG package. That executable is set in the SAS_EXTLANG_SETTINGS file.
   However, if you define $MAS_PYPATH you can then use it in the SAS_EXTLANG_SETTINGS file. For example,

   ```<LANGUAGE name="PYTHON3" interpreter="$MAS_PYPATH"></LANGUAGE>```

3. Attach storage to your SAS Viya platform deployment. The python-transformer.yaml file uses PatchTransformers in Kustomize to attach the volume containing your Python installation to the SAS Viya platform. Replace {{ VOLUME-ATTRIBUTES }} with the appropriate volume specification.

   For example, when using an NFS mount, the {{ VOLUME-ATTRIBUTES }} tag should be replaced with `nfs: {path: /vol/python, server: myserver.sas.com}`
   where `myserver.sas.com` is the NFS server and `/vol/python` is the NFS path you recorded in the Prerequisites step.

   The relevant code excerpt from python-transformer.yaml file before the change:

   ```yaml
   patch: |-
   # Add Python Volume
     - op: add
       path: /spec/template/spec/volumes/-
       value: { name: python-volume, {{ VOLUME-ATTRIBUTES }} }
   ```

   The relevant code excerpt from python-transformer.yaml file after the change:

   ```yaml
   patch: |-
   # Add Python Volume
     - op: add
       path: /spec/template/spec/volumes/-
       value: { name: python-volume, nfs: {path: /vol/python, server: myserver.sas.com} }
   ```

4. Also in the python-transformer.yaml file, there is a PatchTransformer called sas-python-sas-java-policy-allow-list. This PatchTransformer sets paths to the Python executable so that the SAS runtime
   allows execution of the Python code. Replace the {{ PYTHON-EXE-DIR }} and {{ PYTHON-EXECUTABLE }} tags with the appropriate values. If you are specifying multiple Python
   environments, set each of them here.   Here is an example:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: builtin
   kind: PatchTransformer
   metadata:
     name: add-python-sas-java-policy-allow-list
   patch: |-
     - op: add
       path: /data/SAS_JAVA_POLICY_ALLOW_DM_PYPATH
       value: /python/python3/bin/python3.8
     - op: add
       path: /data/SAS_JAVA_POLICY_ALLOW_DM_PYPATH2
       value: /python/python2/bin/python2.7
   target:
     kind: ConfigMap
     name: sas-programming-environment-java-policy-config
   ```

5. Python runs in a separate container in the sas-microanalytic-score pod. Default resource limits are defined for the Python container in the python-transformer.yaml file. Depending upon your application requirements, the CPU and memory values can be modified in the resources section of that file.

    ```yaml
     command: ["$(MAS_PYPATH)", "$(MAS_M2PATH)"]
     envFrom:
     - configMapRef:
         name: sas-open-source-config-python
     - configMapRef:
         name: sas-open-source-config-python-mas
     resources:
       requests:
         memory: 50Mi
         cpu: 50m
       limits:
         memory: 500Mi
         cpu: 500m
    ```

6. Make the following changes to the base kustomization.yaml file in the $deploy directory.

   * Add site-config/sas-open-source-config/python to the resources block.
   * Add site-config/sas-open-source-config/python/python-transformer.yaml to the transformers block before the `sas-bases/overlays/required/transformers.yaml`.

   Here is an example:

   ```yaml
     resources:
     - site-config/sas-open-source-config/python

     transformers:
     ...
     - site-config/sas-open-source-config/python/python-transformer.yaml
     - sas-bases/overlays/required/transformers.yaml
   ```

7. The Process Orchestration feature requires additional tasks to configure Python. If your deployment includes the Process Orchestration feature, then perform the steps in the README located at `$deploy/sas-bases/examples/sas-airflow/python/README.md` (for Markdown format) or at `$deploy/sas-bases/docs/configure_python_for_process_orchestration.htm` (for HTML format).

   **Note:** If you are not certain if your deployment includes Process Orchestration, look at the directory path for the README described above. If the README is present, then Process Orchestration is included in your deployment. If the README is not present, Process Orchestration is not included in the deployment, and you should go to the next step.


8. Complete the deployment steps to apply the new settings. See [Deploy the Software](http://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=itopscdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=dplyml0phy0dkr&docsetTarget=p127f6y30iimr6n17x2xe9vlt54q.htm) in _SAS Viya Platform: Deployment Guide_.

   **Note:** This overlay can be applied during the initial deployment of the SAS Viya platform or after the deployment of the SAS Viya platform.

   * If you are applying the overlay during the initial deployment of the SAS Viya platform, complete all the tasks in the README files that you want to use, then run `kustomize build` to create and apply the manifests.
   * If the overlay is applied after the initial deployment of the SAS Viya platform, run `kustomize build` to create and apply the manifests.

   All affected pods, except the CAS Server pod, are automatically restarted when the overlay is applied. If the overlay is applied after the initial deployment, the CAS Server might need an explicit restart. For information, see [Restart CAS Server](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=sasadmincdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=calserverscas&docsetTarget=n03003viyaservers000000admin.htm&locale=en#p10hialoaqhwrtn1fuhsuakffwtv).

## Verify Overlay for Python Volume

1. Run the following command to verify whether the overlay has been applied:

   ```sh
   kubectl describe pod  <sas-microanalyticscore-pod-name> -n <name-of-namespace>
   ```

2. Verify that the output contains the following mount directory paths:

   ```yaml
   Mounts:
     /python (r)
   ```
