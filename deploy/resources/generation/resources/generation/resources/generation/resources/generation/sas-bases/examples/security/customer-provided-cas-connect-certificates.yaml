## Example SecretGenerator to generate the secret to be used by CAS and Connect
##
## In the following code, the locations that require user specified values are indicated by a capitalized and
## hyphenated name set off by curly braces and a space at each end. You should replace this token with the
## actual value.
## Replace the curly braces, interior spaces, and the variable name.
## For instance, "{{ CAS_CERTIFICATE_FILE_NAME }}"
## should be replaced by the path to a .pem file containing your CAS certificate.
## If you use the suggested example, the correct, final syntax would be:
## - tls.crt=site-config/security/cas.crt
## - tls.key=site-config/security/cas.key
##
##
## For instance, "{{ CONNECT_CERTIFICATE_FILE_NAME }}"
## should be replaced by the path to a .pem file containing your CAS certificate.
## If you use the suggested example, the correct, final syntax would be:
## - tls.crt=site-config/security/connect.crt
## - tls.key=site-config/security/connect.key
##
##  Special Note:  the names of the kubernetes secrets which will contain the certificates and keys can be
##  renamed.  However, the names provided below "sas-cas-certificate" and "sas-connect-certificate" are referenced in other kustomization
##  files.  If you change the names below, you will need to change all the other references: sas-certframe init-container env section
## for CASDeployments, the deployment named sas-connect-spawner, and the PodTemplate named sas-connect-pod-template.
##  Use the sas-bases/overlays/network/ingress/security/transformers/customer-provided-certificates-transformers.yaml as guidance.
