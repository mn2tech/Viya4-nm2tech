## Example ConfigMap that defines the ingress configuration inputs. The inputs
## in this ConfigMap are all commented out by default. To specify an input, uncomment the
## desired input and define a value as described below. If you include this ConfigMap,
## ensure that you have uncommented and defined at least one input.
##
## The location that requires a user-specified value is indicated by a capitalized
## name set off by curly braces and a space at each end. Replace this token with the
## actual value. Replace the curly braces, interior spaces, and the variable name.
## For instance, {{ INGRESS_CLASS_NAME }} should be replaced by the desired class name for
## this deployment's Ingress resources.
## Example:
##   className: "viya-ingress-class"
